# PyPlusSci

This project is the third homework assignment for the *Advanced Programming* course at the University of Trieste. It builds upon the previous C++ sci-toolbox library, transforming it into an enhanced scientific toolbox that integrates seamlessly with Python. By leveraging Python’s versatility, this project not only allows the usage of the original C++ library in Python but also extends its functionality with additional features.

The toolbox consists of two primary modules:

- **Statistics Module**  
- **Interpolation Module**  

To ensure reliability, the project also includes comprehensive tests for all functionalities. Additionally, two dedicated applications are provided to demonstrate and test the modules in action.

## How to build

### Installing third part libraries

The two modules uses functions from *GSL-GNU Scientific Library* and *BOOST library*, so its necessary to install both libraries before building the toolbox.

You can install the third part library from the terminal writing

```bash
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```
for BOOST and

```bash
sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev
```
for GSL.

Here's a clearer and more concise version of the instructions:

---

### Building `sci-toolbox`

`sci-toolbox` uses CMake for its build process. To build both the shared libraries and the associated applications, run the following commands from the project's root directory:

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

#### Custom Builds

To build only one of the two libraries and its associated applications, specify the desired options with `ON` or `OFF`. For example, to build the `DataFrame` library and exclude the `Interpolation` library, use:

```bash
cmake -B build -DBUILD_LIB_DATAFRAME=ON -DBUILD_LIB_INTERPOLATION=OFF
cmake --build build
```

Adjust `ON` and `OFF` based on your requirements.

### Running the apps
After completing the build process, the applications will be available as executables in the `/build/apps` directory, named `stat_app` and `interpol_app`. To run them, simply type the following in the terminal:

```bash
./build/apps/stat_app iris.csv iris_analysis.txt 
./build/apps/interpol_app
```
For the `stat_app` you need to provide other two inputs to the terminal: the dataset name (with its extension) and the output filename (.txt). The dataset must be stored in the `datasets` folder and the output files will be saved in the `output` folder. Eventually this can be modified from the `stat_app.cpp` source file.

## Module A: Statistics
The `DataFrame` class serves as the core of the statistics module, offering a comprehensive framework for data storage, manipulation, and analysis. It includes functionalities for reading from file (CSV, JSON), handling tabular data and performing basic statistical operations.

The class stores its data in a **column-oriented** structure, which means the data is maintained as a **vector of column vectors**. This design choice has several implications for performance and flexibility, particularly for operations involving entire columns or statistical calculations.

Each element in the DataFrame can either be a `double` or a `std::string`, this is achieved using the C++ `std::variant` type. Each column is represented as a vector of `std::optional<DataType>`. The use of `std::optional` allows individual elements to be `null` or missing ( i.e. `std::nullopt`).

The class provides methods for reading data from both CSV and JSON files. For details on these methods, as well as the available statistical functions, refer to the corresponding `.hpp` and `.cpp` files.

Finally, the class also provides an iterator that allows for easy row-by-row traversal of the DataFrame, for example a range-based loop looks like:

```cpp
for (const auto& row : df) {
    // Each `row` is a vector of std::optional<DataType> representing a dataframe's row.
}
```
